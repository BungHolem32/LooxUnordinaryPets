# Loox Unordinary Pets

#### Why?

This task created as part of home assignment of LOOX company.

It was built on Vue Framework at the front and expressJs in the back.

#### Whats the mission?

- Create 5 objects in an array that has the data you need (see later)
- Fetch the magical objects you created and render the attached layout under a nice URL (with the main object Id somehow)
- If you're stuck on something just move on... :)
